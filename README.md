# Context

This template provides a minimal setup to get React Project. It lets you quickly get started on a React project with Tailwind and Vitest for unit testing. A CI starter is also included in the template.

# Template structure

This template has a fairly common structure, with a folder for CICD workflows, a public folder and a source folder. A few rules from the linter are used to add a working environment to TypeScript.

## Structuring the various `src` folder

In the `src` folder, you can find various subfolders. These are all created in the same way. Namely, a subfolder with a descriptive name and his file. In the template, you'll find them under the name `Example...tsx`. Feel free to rename them or simply delete them to work with something other than `Example...tsx`.

What's more, a subfolder can itself have several subfolders. For example, the `User` component can be made up of `UserProfile`, `UserInformation`, `UserImg`, each with its own file.

Let's have a look at the different folders:

- `components`: folder containing all application components
- `containers`: folder containing the application's container(s)
- `hooks`: folder containing the various custom hooks
- `icons`: folder containing the project's icons in `svg` code form. Sub-folders for icon families such as `GeneralIcons`, `MediaIcons`, etc. are also possible.
- `layout`: folder containing the project's layout(s), such as grids
- `pages`: folder containing the page(s), whether a SPA or not
- `typographies`: folder containing typographic components for title levels and paragraphs
- `utils`: folder containing utility functions and their associated spec files

Please note that in the `Typographies` folder, as these components are generic, they are already fully written. Modify the `Headings` component if your title levels go beyond `h3`.

Finally, in the `definitions.ts` file, you'll find all the useful interfaces and types.

## Adding `meta-tags` to the project

In the `index.html` file, meta tags for author, description and keywords are already available. Feel free to modify them or simply add another!

## Description of `package.json` scripts

Various scripts are already available in the `package.json` file, but don't hesitate to add your own if you have others!

Here are those already available:

- `dev`: simply launch the local development server on port `5173`
- `dev:compile`: compiles TypeScript files in real time (thanks to the `--watch` flag) during dev phases to ensure that changes don't affect the linter
- `dev:format`: just formats files (<kbd>ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>s</kbd> works just as well with the prettier file)
- `build`: vite command to send the project to production
- `lint`: the project linter
- `test`: vitest command to launch unit test suites

# How to use it

To use this template, click on `Use this template > Create a new repository` at the top right of this page.

Once you've done this, you'll be taken to the standard interface for creating a project, this time using the present template as a base.

Next, the classic steps:

```bash
$ git clone
$ cd path/to/our/project
$ npm i
$ npm run dev
```

And.... happy codings!! ðŸ¥³
